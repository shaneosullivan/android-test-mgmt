          <p>
            Android Beta Testing is a free service that helps Android app
            developers streamline their beta testing process by automating
            Google Group management and promotional code distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tool was created to solve the common pain points developers
            face when managing beta testers, making it easier to distribute
            promotional codes for paid apps and track tester engagement.
